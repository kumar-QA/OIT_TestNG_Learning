TestNg
--------
Asseration:validating the customer req is called as asserations

how we are validating: by comparing expectedvalue and ActualValue

Assert--it is predefined class
 assertequal()
asserttrue()
assertfalse()

how mant type Assertion?
1.Hard Assert-----
Ex:
------
Assert.assertEqual();

2.softAssert--it is predefined class
  assertequal()
  asserttrue()
  assertfalse()
ex:
SoftAssert s=new SoftAssert();
	s.assertEquals(actualvalue, expectedvalue);
	s.assertAll();

differences b/w hard assert and soft assert

hard assert                               soft assert
1.no need to create object                1.need to create object
2.asseration is failed below the code not exectued  2.it is executed
3.immediately it will throw error                  3.it is in our hands where we need 
                                                          to thow error(assertAll())
